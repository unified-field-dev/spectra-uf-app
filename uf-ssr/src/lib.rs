//! Higgs-backed SSR helpers replacing the template `orbital::ssr` module for standalone
//! `uf-app` repos.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - **Request-scoped [`Valence`]** — [`ssr::valence`] resolves the current request's actor
//!   (via [`higgs::Higgs`]) into a permission-checked [`Valence`] handle, so server functions
//!   never have to parse claims themselves.
//! - **Operation context passthrough** — [`ssr::current_operation`] / [`ssr::with_operation`]
//!   are re-exported from [`uf_host`] so callers only need to depend on this crate.
//!
//! *This crate has no auth model of its own* — it only adapts [`higgs::Higgs`] request context
//! into the [`Valence`] type your server functions already expect.
//!
//! ## Getting started
//!
//! Call [`ssr::valence`] from any `#[server]` function to get a session scoped to the caller:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use leptos::prelude::ServerFnError;
//!
//! #[leptos::server]
//! pub async fn my_endpoint() -> Result<String, ServerFnError> {
//!     let db = uf_ssr::ssr::valence().await?;
//!     // ... use `db` for permission-checked reads/writes ...
//!     Ok("ok".into())
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This crate is only compiled with an `ssr` module when the `ssr` feature is enabled; on the
//! client (`hydrate`/`csr` builds) it exposes nothing.
//!
//! ## Where to look next
//!
//! - [`ssr`] — the SSR-only module with [`ssr::valence`].
